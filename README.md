# Protosnirk

A programming language built iteratively.


## What is this?

This is a "toy"/"example"/"learning" programming language.
Instead of trying to build the next Java, I start with every
compilers 101 class's first assignment: the calculator with variables.

## Why the name?

Snirk isn't actually my name (neither is Immington). I've always wanted
to create a programming language, but I alone am not in the position to
create an amazing one. So I'll learn my way through it, iterating on
prototypes, until I can create a real language, Snirk.

## What is the status? What is proto?

Protosnirk will be "proto" until it's a _real_ language - it's not even
Turing complete right now. Until then, each version will add core features
that "real" languages have (aiming toward statically typed, reference counted).

However, development is free to be fluid. For example, a virtual machine can be
developed on independently of static typing - the project could be forked to
create a scripting language, for example.

The _proto_ language is in "alpha" right now. When there's a nice, stable
virtual machine we can transition to "beta" and ultimately there will be full
versions - "real" Snirk will come far later (and probably use LLVM).

## Why is this special?

It's not really special right now. There are a few other serious embedded Rust
languages right now that are worth checking out.
